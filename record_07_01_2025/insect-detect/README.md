- All models were trained to 300 epochs with batch size 32 and default hyperparameters. Reproduce the
  model training with the provided [Google Colab notebooks](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml#model-training).
- Trained on [Insect_Detect_detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection)
  dataset [version 7](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection/dataset/7),
  downscaled to 320x320 pixel with only 1 class ("insect").
- Model metrics (mAP, Precision, Recall) are shown for the original PyTorch (.pt) model before conversion to ONNX ->
  OpenVINO -> .blob format. Reproduce metrics by using the respective model validation method.
- Speed (fps) is shown for the converted models (.blob 4 shaves), running on OAK-1 connected to RPi Zero 2 W (~2 fps slower
  with object tracker). Set `cam_rgb.setFps()` to the respective fps shown for each model to reproduce the speed measurements.
- While connected via SSH (X11 forwarding of the frames), print fps to the console and comment out `cv2.imshow()`,
  as forwarding the frames will slow down the received message output and thereby fps. If you are using
  a Raspberry Pi 4 B connected to a screen, fps will be correctly shown in the livestream (see gif).

## Processing pipeline

> [!NOTE]
> The new version of the processing pipeline (November 2024) differs to the descriptions in the
> PLOS ONE paper and on the documentation website (will be updated soon). Please refer to the
> following points for an up-to-date description.

Processing pipeline for the
[`yolo_tracker_save_hqsync.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect/blob/main/yolo_tracker_save_hqsync.py)
script that can be used for automated insect monitoring:

- A custom **YOLO insect detection model** is run in real time on device (OAK) and uses a
  continuous stream of downscaled LQ frames (default: 320x320 px) as input
- An **object tracker** uses the bounding box coordinates of detected insects to assign a unique
  tracking ID to each individual present in the frame and track its movement through time
- The object tracker (+ model) output from inference on LQ frames is synchronized with
  **MJPEG-encoded HQ frames** (default: 3840x2160 px) on device (OAK) using the respective timestamps
- The encoded HQ frames are saved to the Raspberry Pi's SD card at the specified **capture interval**
  (default: 1 second) if an insect is detected and tracked and independent of detections at the
  specified timelapse interval (default: 10 minutes)
- Corresponding **metadata** from the detection model and tracker output (including timestamp, label,
  confidence score, tracking ID, tracking status and bounding box coordinates) is saved to a
  metadata .csv file for each detected and tracked insect at the specified capture interval
- The metadata can be used to **crop detected insects** from the HQ frames and save them as individual
  .jpg images and/or save a copy of the frame with overlays. Depending on the post-processing settings,
  the original HQ frames will be optionally deleted after the processing to save storage space
- During the recording, a maximum pipeline speed of **~19 FPS** for 4K resolution (3840x2160) and
  **~42 FPS** for 1080p resolution (1920x1080) can be reached if the capture interval is set to 0
  and the camera frame rate is adjusted accordingly
- With default settings, the new pipeline consumes **~3.8 W** during recording (previous version: ~4.4 W)

Check out the [classification](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/)
instructions and the [`insect-detect-ml`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml) GitHub repo for
information on how to classify the cropped detections with the provided classification model and script.

Take a look at the [post-processing](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/post-processing/)
instructions for information on how to post-process the metadata with classification results.
